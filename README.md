# Brent-Corpus-Text-Analysis
Text processing done for soon-to-be published Speech Pathology paper

The Brent et al Corpus includes speech delivered to 5-11 month old children from their mothers.
Each mother has a series of recorded sessions speaking to their children.
These sessions were then transcribed and coded into excel files.
The authors of a paper analyzing this speech needed the entire corpus processed, including word counts, lemmatizations,
and a method to establish membership in other vocabularies.
